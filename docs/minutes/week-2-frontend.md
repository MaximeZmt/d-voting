## Updates

Each member of the team has created a PR:

- Khadija added types on index.tsx
- Ghita started changing "election" to "form" in the codebase. She mentions having spent a lot of time trying to make the nodes work
- Ahmed changed the favicon

## ToDo Next

- [ ] For the presentation we should be able to tell what everyone would be doing during the semester. It doesn't have to be precise but has to show that we have a plan. 
- [ ] Modify the readme with the configuration of the linter.
- [ ] Add information about questions as : "Here you need to enter your name and your surname in 10 characters"

## Others
We decide with Noémien what everyone wants to do.
We try to configure the linter on everyone's machine. It was not easy.
We found an error that is we can click multiple time on the cast button when it is loading.
