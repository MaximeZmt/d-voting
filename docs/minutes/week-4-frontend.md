## Updates & next things

- Ghita had a lot of issues with trying to launch the system since she refactored the codebase. We look at it a little bit. She’ll find a way to make it work. Besides that she began trying to implement Casbin. Noémien and Ghita quickly discuss the benefits and drawbacks of roles vs user based. Everything is going well and she’s continuing that way.
- Ahmed began to look at the amount of work he would have to do to add the hint field. Noémien thinks that he should start by doing all the work on the interface and then look at how to change in the backend and smart contract way later. Ahmed is going to do this and change the mocks as well to make it work.
- Khadija started translation and is looking among her friends for a german speaking person so that they can check if she’s doing correct work. Noémien says that she should actually focus more on the actual i18n implementation on the interface. She will do so next.
