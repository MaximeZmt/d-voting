# The proxy address to which frontend can make call. Likely to be behind a
# reverse proxy:
#
export proxy_addr="0.0.0.0:9080"
#
# Prometheus endpoint for dvoting metrics, available at the "/metrics" URL:
#
export prometheus_addr="0.0.0.0:9100"
#
# Prometheus node exporter endpoint (provide system metrics):
#
export node_exporter_addr="0.0.0.0:9101"
#
# Blockchain node listen address. Can be local as blockchain nodes use their
# "dela_public" URLs to exchange message. It MUST contain a port:
#
export dela_listen="tcp://0.0.0.0:9000"
#
# Logging level. One of warn, trace, info, error, debug:
#
export LLVL=info

# Likely to be updated:

#
# The public URL of the blockchain node. This URLs should be a publicly
# accessible URL over TLS that redirects to the node's address. This is likely
# to be reversed-proxied to the dela_listen address. It MUST contain a port:
#
export dela_public="//localhost:9000"

# To be updated:

#
# Certificate/key used by gRPC to secure exchanges. Be careful that the dvoting
# user must be able to read from those:
#
export dela_cert_chain="/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem"
export dela_cert_key="/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem"
#
# Public key of the web backend. This is trusting the component that does
# authentication and authorization:
